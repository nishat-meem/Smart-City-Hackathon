BMW Smart City Stakeholder Deal
Introducing a bonus system where lazy drivers pay drivers who move out early. 

## Inspiration
<p>Learning from the current pandemic, we say that an incentive needs to have a form of monetary penalty and cannot rely on social pressure only: Wearing masks was only widely accepted when not wearing one was penalized with a fee.</p>
## What it does
<p>The ultimate goal is to meet the goal of every stakeholder involed. Specifically that is: The car owner wants to get a parking spot quickly. The charging station wants to have the cars to free the parking spots when fully charged. BMW wants to satisfy customer needs by providing parking spots.</p>
<p>Within the Smart City Stakeholder Deal, BMW rewards drivers who move their car from the charging spot within one hour when charged fully with bonus points. Drivers who are willing to stay for a longer time are fined with a monetary penalty. This means that the latter group of drivers are paying the compensate the drivers who move out on time. </p>
## Challenges we ran into
<p>Using data to support business case.</p>
<p>Identify reasons why there is no law nor mechanism yet which regulates the time a car is allowed to stay when fully charged.</p>
